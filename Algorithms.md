+ ALgorithms = A sequence of computational sets that transform the input into the output.
+ Instance of a problem = Consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem.
+ An algorithm is said to be correct if for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.
+ Remarkable property of NP complete problems = If an efficient algorithm exists for any one of them, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them.
+ NP complete problems are similar but not identical to problems for which we know efficient algorithms.
+ NP complete problems occur often in real applications, hence if we know a problem is NP complete then we can spend time on developing an efficient algorithm that gives good, but not the best possible solution, hence saving our time.
+ To elicit best performance from multicore computers, we must design algorithms with parallelism in mind - Multithreaded algorithms.
